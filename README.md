# Indexing Something something

This module is for comparing human indexing to automated indexing of scholarly journal articles (or similarly structured publications). It allows you to split up the indexing tasks for a pool of articles among a set of users, with a set number of users indexing the same article. 


# Instructions


## References

Each journal article is represented as a Reference (based on the BibCite module).  For convenience we put all references in the "Journal Article" type of reference. 

In order to be analyzed, references must be added to pools. This can be done at /indexing/references. 

## Pools

A pool is a set of references (journal articles) to undergo human-robot indexing comparison.
